## About this Project
-Every productive person usually partakes in notetaking

-Due to this, i developed a note taker that allows any user/business owner to write, save and view written notes.

-This in turn makes it easy for the user to have a place where all their notes are stored and allows him to delete or add more. Viewing the prevoiusly written notes works as well.

This project uses
[Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) server Web Framework
[Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) Dev dependency. Allows me to see the new server every time the file is saved.
